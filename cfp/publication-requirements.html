<h2>Publication Requirements for ICIT 2016</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
ICIT 2016 Proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and will be sent to IEEE Xplore and DBLP for indexing.All submitted papers will undergo double-blind-review consisting of leading researchers around the globe. Authors need to prevent identity disclosure by (1) not listing names and affiliations of the authors on the manuscript, (2) not saying "my work" or "our work" in the text while citing self-references, and (3) not writing acknowledgments in such a way that identity of authors are implied. Author information should only be included in the submission form. All accepted papers will be published provided that at least one author registers for the conference.
