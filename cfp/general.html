<h2>Call for Papers: ICIT 2016</h2>

<h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT) is a premier international forum for sharing high quality research in the areas of Information Technology. ICIT-2016 is being organized by Orissa Information Technology Society in collaboration with IEEE and IIIT Bhubaneshwar. Researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry are invited to present their research findings on various topics of IT and its applications.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
ICIT encourages submissions in all the areas of information technology. However, the papers in the following tracks will be the primary focus of ICIT-2016. The submissions in each track could be on, but not limited to, the following topics:

</dd>
</dl>

<p class="text-justify">
All papers should be full papers, and papers may belong to more than one category. Note that papers from any research area can fall into any of these categories, as the categories are constructed surrounding methodological approaches, not research topics (e.g., one could write an analytical paper on a new analysis technique, an empirical paper that compares a broad range of such techniques, a technological paper that makes an analysis technique practically feasible and available, or a perspectives paper that reviews the state of the art and lays out a roadmap of analysis techniques for the future).
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below) and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of soundness, importance of contribution, originality, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and convincing evaluation of the proposed approach. Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to ICIT 2016 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICIT 2016.
</p>

<h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
Please review the <a href="/cfp/publication-requirements.html">ICIT 2016 Publication Requirements</a> for more details.
Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.
</p>

<h3>How to Submit</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
Submissions must be formatted according to the <a href="/cfp/formatting-instructions.html">ICIT 2016 Formatting Instructions</a>. Papers must not exceed 6 pages. All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icit20161">ICIT 2016 EasyChair</a> conference management system.
