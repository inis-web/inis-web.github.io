<h2>Call for Papers: iNIS 2017</h2>

<h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
The primary objective of the IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (IEEE-iNIS) is to provide a platform for both hardware and software researchers to 
interact under one umbrella for further development of efficient and secure information processing technologies. 
Efficient and secure data sensing, storage, and processing play pivotal roles in current information age. 
The state-of-the-art nanoelectronic technology based hardware systems cater to the needs of efficient sensing, 
storage, and computing. At the same time, efficient algorithms and software used for faster analysis and 
retrieval of desired information are becoming increasingly important. Big data which are large, complex data sets, 
are now a part of the Internet world. Storing and processing needs of the enormous amount of structured and 
unstructured data are getting increasingly challenging. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT) and 
cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been evolving with simultaneous development of hardware and software and
span across everyday consumer electronics. The performance and efficiency of the present as well as the 
future generations of computing and information processing systems are largely dependent upon advances 
in both hardware and software. </p>

<p class="text-justify">
iNIS 2017 is sponsored by IEEE-CS under TCVLSI. iNIS has been initiated as a sponsored 
meeting of Technical Committee on VLSI, IEEE-CS (http://www.ieee-tcvlsi.org/) 
that endorses a league of  successful meetings such as ASAP, ISVLSI, ARITH, etc., 
which are now presented as "Sister Conferences" in the iNIS website. 
iNIS brings together leading scientists and researchers from academia and industry. 
Contributions are sought in (but are not limited to) the following areas:</p>
<dl>
<dt>(1) Nanoelectronic VLSI and Sensor Systems (NVS) </dt>

</dl>


<p class="text-justify">
iNIS 2017 proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS conference 
publication services (CPS). Authors are invited to submit full-length
(6 pages maximum), original, unpublished research papers with an abstract 
(200 words maximum).</p>

<h3>Evaluation and Template</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
Papers violating length would be excluded from the review process. 
Previously published papers or papers currently under review for other conferences/journals 
should not be submitted and will not be considered for publication. 
Authors should submit their original work of maximum 6 pages using 
double-column <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE-CS conference format-template</a>.
A selected papers from iNIS 2017 program will be invited for submission 
to a peer-reviewed journal special issue based on reviewer feedback and 
quality of conference presentation. </p>
