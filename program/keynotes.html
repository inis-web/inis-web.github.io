Title: ThirdEye: Visual Assist for Grocery Shopping<br/>
Tentative Date: TBA <br/>
Tentative Time: TBA<br/>
Abstract: Shopping is widely considered as a relaxing leisure activity. However, grocery shopping can be a frustrating experience for those with visual impairment. While getting to a grocery shop itself is not as much of a challenge for them, locating and picking the items in the grocery shelf becomes a task as challenging as picking a needle from the haystack. Imagine picking up five items for your dinner recipe from a typical grocery store in the US that carries around 35,000 unique items and can have more than 30 aisles spanning 45,000 square meters. This talk will showcase synergistic advances in algorithms, architectures and interface design for assisting those with visual impairment to do shopping.<br/>

Title: Challenges of Converging Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology for Internet of Things<br/>
Tentative Date: TBA <br/>
Tentative Time: TBA<br/>
Abstract: Current trends in Internet of Things (IoT) require the convergence of Nanoelectronics, Nanotechnology, Communication Technology and Information Technology. Sensor systems monitoring environment, health care, water quality, vehicle traffic, smart cities are becoming the norm. Despite extended range of applications low power requirement is the key to these nanosystems. Incorporation of different nanodevices into these nanosystems with functionalities that do not necessarily scale according to "Moore's Law,‚Äù but provide additional value in different ways (more than Moore), is necessary. It is therefore important to get exposed to the current trend in chip fabrication, device structures and fabrication (gate stack design and fabrication), device and circuit relationship and design, reliability of new devices and processes. Furthermore, nanoelectronic devices with extremely low power consumption depends on the next generation high-k deposition process, precise selection of deposition parameters, pre-deposition surface treatments and subsequent annealing temperatures. In this talk, some of the recent developments in device fabrication for electronics devices and IoT devices will be outlined.<br/>

Title: Reduced Dimension-based Emerging Novel Switching Transistors and Interconnects for Post-CMOS Electronics<br/>
Tentative Date: TBA <br/>
Tentative Time: TBA<br/>
      Abstract: Focus of this presentation will be on reduced dimension materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and other than graphene-based emerging novel switching transistors and interconnects for future integrated circuit design and wide-ranging other applications. Addressing the needs of post-CMOS electronics, development of current transport models of transistors based on these materials will be presented which can be used for the design of ultra-low power and high frequency nanoscale integrated electronic circuits. Use of carbon nanotubes, graphene and graphene-copper hybrid material as a possible solution for the replacement of copper interconnect in nanometer CMOS technology nodes will also be included in presentation.<br/>
